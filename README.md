### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently @ talus.bio (a seed-stage biotech startup working on drug development for gene regulators). I joined in early 2021 as first employee and have since been diving deep into the exciting world of biology.
I'm interested in gene regulatory networks, bioelectricity and longevity.

#### Some stuff I've worked on:
- [Semantic Podcast Search (using Lex Fridman's AI podcast)](https://github.com/ricomnl/podcast_search)
- Accompanying code to my blog post [Bioinformatics pipeline example from the bottom up](https://ricomnl.com/blog/bottom-up-bioinformatics-pipeline/): [bioinformatics-pipeline-tutorial](https://github.com/ricomnl/bioinformatics-pipeline-tutorial)

While participating in the [How To Grow (Almost) Anything course](https://www.notion.so/htgaa22-ricomeinl/Rico-Meinl-efa379490adc4c169e51f9e7b0af4b87) on Synthetic Bio:
- Opentrons protocol to draw 8x8 digits in 96-well plates: [opentron_digits](https://github.com/ricomnl/opentron_digits)
- Protein structure analysis of KLF4 using nglview: [protein_structure_analysis](https://github.com/ricomnl/protein_structure_analysis) | [online docs](https://ricomnl.github.io/protein_structure_analysis/notebooks/analysis.html)

#### Contributions:
- During the bitsinbio hackathon in March '22, I contributed to [graphein](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein)
- EncyclopeDIA - a library search engine comprised of several algorithms for data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry data analysis: [encyclopedia](https://bitbucket.org/searleb/encyclopedia/src/master/)
- Gopher - Gene ontology enrichment analysis using protein expression: [gopher](https://github.com/TalusBio/gopher)
